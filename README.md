# Basil
While looking at the design recommendations that Google gives in Material Design 2, I liked the [Basil](https://m2.material.io/design/material-studies/basil.html) app. I did not find a ready-made solution for this application on the Internet (although, to be honest, I didn't really look for it). Therefore, in this repository, I would like to create this application based on all recommendations for design and clean code
